 <p style="color:white;" style="font-size: 30px;">In this section you will see my portfolio, it will mainly consist of
  my clothing, you'll be able to see some of the pieces I've made. Each piece I make is a 1 of 1, each person gets a slightly
  different piece, and they have the ability to ask for it to be customized. When creating my clothing I like to go for a darker
  more grunge look, and that's what you can see here!</p>

    <p style="color:white;" style="font-size: 30px;"> I've been making these clothes since 2017, and I've continued to make them ever since,I do it less now due to 
    college and work, but it's a great creative outlet on the side! When I was really pursuing clothing we hit 2,000 followers on instagram and we were doing photo
    shoots and things of that nature, covid-19 really through everything off though, blank clothes were harder to get, and meeting up for photoshoots was a no go during
    the early 2020 lockdown, so i shifted my focus to school and the IT field!</p>
